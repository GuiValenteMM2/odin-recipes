# odin-recipes
I am going to write some codes in order to develop my skills.
This time I will be using the basics of HTML that I learned with the Odin Project.
I am building four pages, one for the links, and one for the recipes.
The pattern will be the same for the recipes, the focus will be on simplicity(all that I know!!!).
Styling using CSS.
